1. Custom Hook - useful for easy optimmisation of our application like eg, create a custom hook for useEffect api call and render this hook into page

2. In the production buid file generate, In this file the main \index.html page exits but suppose we have to create any new or different section then our application is slow because loading and run time increases for this, we can create Lazy loading and divide our application in chunks like eg, index.html and groccery.html for this Loading we have to use Suspense

3.Lazy Loading also know
i. code splitting
ii. dynamic import

4. Syntax
const Groccery = lazy(() => import('component/Groccery'))

5. for creating this bundler they take some time, for that react gives error because in start they do not have any component for Groccery

for resolving this error we use Suspense
{
    path: "/groccery",
    element: "<Suspense fallback = {<h1>Loading...</h1>}><Groccery /> </Suspense>"
}


---------------------------------

HOFC(Higher order function component) = Hofc is a function which take component as an parameter and return new component


----------------------------------

Diffence between import FilterSection & import {useState, context} basicall normal import & import {}

if there is an default export FilterSection then : import FilterSection
if there is an no default export FilterSection then : import {FilterSection}

---------------------------------


***************useContext********************

if i want to pass any prop from 1 component to 4th component so basically we do prop drilling, 
(1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4), but we are not using this props in (2, 3, 4) component, so there is no use of passing this props in every component

Solution: We can use useContext, can create a global store -> create data -> and pass wherever we need
